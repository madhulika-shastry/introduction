ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @madhulika-shastry. I am a social psychology PhD student at the Ohio State University working with Dr. Kurt Gray. I study how large language models (LLMs) and social media algorithms influence our social behaviors. In this area of research, I am particularly interested in our empathic behaviors towards victims of moral transgressions. Upon completing my doctorate in the Summer of 2028, I hope to join the tech industry and work in applied behavioral research fields. Feel free to reach out to me at shastry.16@osu.edu!
